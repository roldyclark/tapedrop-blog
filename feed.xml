&lt;p&gt;We are proud to announce Tapedrop, the app! Available on iOS and web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tapedrop uses geolocation to connect artists with local music fans. How it works: Artists create a profile with their music links - Apple Music, Spotify, Bandcamp, SoundCloud, Instagram and YouTube. That profile then appears for users within the immediate area. Profiles can be added to a user’s library for later listening, and easily shared. Shareable ‘Artist Cards’ are designed specifically for use as ‘Link in Bio’ pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create your artist profile or start discovering new bands now at &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.tapedrop.com&quot;&gt;app.tapedrop.com&lt;/a&gt; or download the iOS app from &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tapedrop/id1595625980&quot;&gt;the App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia-based metal band &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/morgul_blade_hm/&quot;&gt;Morgul Blade&lt;/a&gt; released their first music video this month. Produced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/ritual_video/&quot;&gt;Ritual Video&lt;/a&gt;, it is animated in the style of an 8-bit side scroller. The story follows a group of swordsman hunting down a dangerous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beast_of_G%C3%A9vaudan&quot;&gt;beast of Gevaudan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video was released by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc2JA2RL-97zdWNz71zg0PA&quot;&gt;No Remorse Records&lt;/a&gt;, who signed the band after their first tape, &lt;a href=&quot;https://morgulblade.bandcamp.com/releases&quot;&gt;Harbingers of Power and the World’s End&lt;/a&gt;, gained a loyal following on bandcamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached out to Lord Klauf, Morgul’s front man, to ask him about the band’s sudden success:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It was very humbling. I initially started this project to just be a hobby to keep myself from watching too much tv and video games, never in a million years thought it would grow into an international label deal and potentially international tour next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also asked for three bands to check out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://malokarpatan.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;Malokarpatan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Slavic blackened heavy metal with excellent worldbuilding and strong melodic hooks”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://torpornoise.bandcamp.com/music&quot;&gt;Torpor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Polish 3-piece that plays Black Metal in the 2nd wave style with heavy metal overtones”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blackmagicnorway.bandcamp.com/album/wizards-spell-2&quot;&gt;Black Magic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Evil heavy metal in the vein of ‘Show No Mercy’ era Slayer… Riffs for fucking days”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Last Waltz of Gevaudan was recorded at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redwaterrecording.com/&quot;&gt;Red Water Recording&lt;/a&gt; in South Philly, along with the rest of Morgul Blades upcoming full length album “Fell Sorcery Abounds”, out by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/noremorserecords/&quot;&gt;No Remorse Records&lt;/a&gt; on November 26, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Harry Herskowitz</name></author><category term="Articles" /><summary type="html">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-cOPiwlEKg</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://tapedrop.com/morgul_blade_video.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://tapedrop.com/morgul_blade_video.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">NYCL Kai drops “Bodies”</title><link href="https://tapedrop.com/2021/04/05/nycl-kai-drops-bodies.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="NYCL Kai drops “Bodies”" /><published>2021-04-05T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-04-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://tapedrop.com/2021/04/05/nycl-kai-drops-bodies</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tapedrop.com/2021/04/05/nycl-kai-drops-bodies.html">&lt;p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmedai0p95s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NYCL Kai just dropped his new single “Bodies” along with a neck-breaking Music Videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directed and shot by Connor Bewighouse (aka Pinkeeout) the video captures the high energy and euphoria of being enveloped in a mosh pit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kai goes absolutely off, back flipping into a crowd and moshing into a smashing finale you do not want to miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Tis the season to rock n’ roll! In celebration of Christmas 2020, John Carr and his band &lt;a href=&quot;https://thecountjosephineband.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;Count Josephine&lt;/a&gt; took to the stage at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stoneponyonline.com/&quot;&gt;The Stone Pony&lt;/a&gt; to perform their Holiday single &lt;a href=&quot;https://thecountjosephineband.bandcamp.com/track/christmas-comes-once-a-year-live-at-the-stone-pony-2020&quot;&gt;Christmas Comes Once A Year&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of our crew at Tapedrop, the performance was released on video in the style of a made-for-TV Christmas Special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song was written by John Carr and performed in true Jersey Shore style, featuring a classic four-chord rhythm, Springsteen-esque bells, and a wailing saxophone solo. It was a heartfelt tribute to The Stone Pony and the Asbury Park tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope this special performance will be a bright spot in a Holiday Season that will be tough for so many of us.

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the Delaware River in a vacant lot in Camden, New Jersey, &lt;a href=&quot;https://linktree.com/barneycortez/&quot;&gt;Barney Cortez&lt;/a&gt; climbed aboard a retired school bus to debut his new music to the world. The song, &lt;a href=&quot;https://barneycortez.bandcamp.com/track/bad-company&quot;&gt;Bad Company&lt;/a&gt;, is the third track of Barney’s new EP, &lt;a href=&quot;https://barneycortez.bandcamp.com/album/drive-thru-heart&quot;&gt;Drive Thru Heart&lt;/a&gt;. Barney showcases his songwriting talents in this lyrical collection of tunes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The school bus and lot were provided by the eccentric guitar designer and artist, Phil Smith of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goldfinchgeetars.com/&quot;&gt;Goldfinch Guitars&lt;/a&gt;. Phil and Alyssa Ritchie, the hooded muse of the video, were in the process of converting the bus for a cross country road trip at the time of the shoot. Also joining the cast is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/aliawan.wav/?hl=en&quot;&gt;Ali Awan&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow Philly musician. The video was shot and edited by our very own &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/roldyclark/?hl=en&quot;&gt;Roldy Clark&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q: What’s your origin story?
A: My life story is pretty crazy, born of Liberian descent, the first generation in my family to be born and raised in the US. My mother put me onto music early through Piano in the 2nd grade. I really wanted to do Karate but she signed me up for Piano anyway. It wasn’t until the 6th grade when I was introduced to actually making raps. Going to the homie Kenan’s house after school with Marcus Gray and Jordan Dash. We would just spend hours listening to beats on cassette tapes, writing and rapping to em. So you can say I’ve been rapping for about 15 years. Professionally? Around 2 to 3 years. What took me so long was coming to terms with the fact that this actually what I was born to do. Had to fight my family, peers, and myself to get to this point. Just glad I didn’t give up forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q: How has your music and persona evolved over time?
A: Definitely has gotten darker over time. I think that is just a natural progression for the type of person I am in accordance to the situations I put myself into. I am a creature of the night life so everything that comes with it has made it’s way into my music. There’s a lot of fun but a lot of what comes in the night is dark. Lust for women, getting intoxicated, longing to feel something but searching for it in all the wrong places. That’s my vibe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q: What is your favorite venue to perform?
A: Pink Sotano was easily my favorite venue to perform at because of how intimate the performances actually are. It’s wild to think how much history has passed through that studio. So many legendary parties were held there as well. If you’re really in the Philly underground scene, you know how lit Pink Sotano was to everyone’s movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q. What artists are you most inspired by?
A: OG wise? Ye easily. Doesn’t get better than that. Us both being Gemini’s with our birthdays a week apart. His video for Diamonds From Sierra Leone was the first Music Videos I ever watched that made me actually want to start doing music for real. From how he has been able to re-create himself on every project, revolutionize the sound, and stand on what he believes in regardless of who has to say anything about it. Ye is the best man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q. How do you feel about the independent rap scene in Philly?
A: It’s dope and a lot of individuals have been working super hard to make improvements to it. I think right now it’s at an all-time high again. I know there was an era before us that was super lit and the vibe I get from everyone is that it’s heading in that direction again. I notice a lot more unity in the scene compared to when I first started coming around and it is definitely dope to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q. Anyone you want to plug?
A: First off my aces, Hashland and MYKA. Both super lit artists I fuck with their music heavy. Hashland really be talking his shit for real on tracks and he be making most of his beats which is super fire to me. He also does all his own mixing and mastering. He’s helped me to learn a ton and elevate my sound crazy. Really my brother for life. Same with MYKA, he has taught me a lot about myself and shown me things I never would’ve recognized without crossing paths with him. Together we form a supergroup called TIL-3 and just seeing how we’re all moving individually, it’s gonna be dope to be on top with my brothers soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Harry Herskowitz</name></author><category term="Articles" /><summary type="html">https://youtu.be/sPD24QvK2Tc</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://tapedrop.com/closecash.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://tapedrop.com/closecash.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The Dead Flowers @ Tapedrop Live</title><link href="https://tapedrop.com/2020/05/14/the-dead-flowers-tapedrop-live.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Dead Flowers @ Tapedrop Live" /><published>2020-05-14T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-05-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://tapedrop.com/2020/05/14/the-dead-flowers-tapedrop-live</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tapedrop.com/2020/05/14/the-dead-flowers-tapedrop-live.html">&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/edQVG6EDV5c?list=PL8Zvz7lKR0wRbMo7EzALfpjxqvIgrRQjr&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long ago, all the way back in the simpler times of February, The Dead Flowers teamed up with Tapedrop for a live session at the Cropwell Friends Meeting House in Marlton, NJ. The audio was engineered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/connorpriest/&quot;&gt;Connor Priest&lt;/a&gt; with microphones provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gradwellhouse.com/&quot;&gt;Gradwell House Recording&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dead Flowers are a classic rock n’ roll band heavily inspired by The Rolling Stones. We talked to Zachary Tyler, the band’s lead guitarist, and he gave us the origin story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We all met at Rutgers and started the band in 2015. I met John at the liquor store we both worked at in the summer and we both wanted to be the next Rolling Stones. From there, the jams began. We recruited Stephen, our keyboard player in 2018 who helped us further develop our sound with his music theory background and innovative playing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flowers are known for their high energy shows. They consistently manage to pack the house thanks to their showmanship. A few years ago they won the battle of the bands at the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stoneponyonline.com/&quot;&gt;Stone Pony&lt;/a&gt; in Asbury Park. Zach told us about that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’d say our craziest show was when we won the battle of the bands. From ripping solos with blood on my face and having the crowd hold me up while I shred, it was the perfect mix of energy and excitement that helped us not only put on a great show, but helped us win the whole competition.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We asked Zach what the band’s biggest influences were, expecting the Rolling Stones, The Grateful Dead - but his response was much more wholesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Aside from the obvious influences, I think our biggest influences are each other. We learn and push each other to the best we can be, and I think that is equally important as all the greats who came before us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dead Flowers are a blast to see live and we’re saddened that it may be awhile before their next gig - but thankfully we have this taped session to hold us over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadcast News released their debut EP on Good Friday after months of crafting in the studio. The 4 song record, running about 22 minutes long, was recorded at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.truelevelstudio.com/&quot;&gt;True Level Studio&lt;/a&gt; in Blackwood, NJ and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gradwellhouse.com/&quot;&gt;Gradwell House Recording&lt;/a&gt; in Haddon Heights, NJ. Adam Ackerman produced the EP with Tom Conran mixing and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/evan-piano.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;evan playing piano&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The band used some experimental techniques to craft their unique sounds. As pictured above, multi-instrumentalist Evan McCullough played grand piano over a guitar amp to achieve sympathetic resonance. The antique pump organ behind him was used in a few tracks. Adam, the producer, played vibraphone on Two Balloons and Tom recorded himself jingling his car keys around the studio for ambience. The band achieved many otherwordly sounds through synths like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.behringer.com/Categories/Behringer/Keyboards/Synthesizers-and-Samplers/DEEPMIND-12/p/P0AC5&quot;&gt;DeepMind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arturia.com/products/hardware-synths/microfreak/overview&quot;&gt;MicroFreak&lt;/a&gt;, and guitar pedals like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.walrusaudio.com/products/julia-analog-chorus-vibrato-v2&quot;&gt;Walrus Julia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://carolineguitar.com/product/meteore/&quot;&gt;Caroline Météore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riding on top of this finely crafted production are the dark, crooning vocals of Aiden Lynch. Aiden sings of love and disillusionment through expressive vibrato over psychedelic harmonies. His emotional scope fluctuates from pain filled refrains like “Why don’t you love me?” to romantic nostalgia in Two Balloons: “We sat outside and watched the sky drift underneath our hanging feet. We talked all day and then at night I dream of you and you dream of me”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brenden Detwiler’s drumming lays the foundation with in-the-pocket grooves underneath Reid Howard’s sliding basslines and Alec Nolan’s heavily effected rhythm guitar. The album is a melting pot of genres, most prominently shoegaze and psychedelic rock. The 8 minute closer ‘I Like Your Planet’ starts as what feels like a krautrock track and abruptly transitions to a heavy prog breakdown to finish out the record.&lt;/p&gt;
